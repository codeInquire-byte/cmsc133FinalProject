# cmsc133FinalProjectOverview

My project is a PVP-Style fighting game with a hierarachal structure between the characters you can use along with their basic attacking power and health, along with special abilities you can grant from different animes, notably being Jujutsu Kaisen and One Piece. 

# Compiling and Running

In order to compile and run this program, there are multiple steps that need to be taken. A driver class must be created, where you would create the main method. In the main method, instances of the class would be created where you could call among any of the methods in the hierarchical structure, so long as you abide by the rules of Polymorphism.

# Classes and Interfaces, and their Roles

## Fighter Interface

The Fighter interface defines the behavior of the classes that are going to implement it. It has the method signatures of *recover* and *gameOver*

# Proposal 

For my final project, I intend to do a PVP-style program where people can choose
different fictional characters (from animes, tv shows, mangas, novels, and games). Each different fictional character will be a separate individual class, and they will be subclasses of a superclass that has commonalities between every character. For my interface, I will make it where it is a shared ability function every single character will do, such as surrendering. I will use File I/O to save character data, and arrays and ArrayLists to select characters from.
